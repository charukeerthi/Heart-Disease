# Introduction

Heart Disease Prediction is a Machine learning project. It is a model created by testing and training of previous datasets of patients to predict the heart disease for a given input. It is used to train, test and predict the heart disease using Jupyter Notebook software.

Heart diseases is a term covering any disorder of the heart. Heart diseases have become a major concern to deal with as studies show that the number of deaths due to heart diseases have increased significantly over the past few decades in India, in fact it has become the leading cause of death in India.

A study shows that from 1990 to 2016 the death rate due to heart diseases have increased around 34 per cent from 155.7 to 209.1 deaths per one lakh population in India.

Thus preventing Heart diseases has become more than necessary. Good data-driven systems for predicting heart diseases can improve the entire research and prevention process, making sure that more people can live healthy lives. This is where Machine Learning comes into play. Machine Learning helps in predicting the Heart diseases, and the predictions made are quite accurate.

# Problem Description

A dataset is formed by taking into consideration some of the information of 303 individuals. Based on the given information about each individual we have to calculate that whether that individual will suffer from heart disease.

# Dataset

The dataset consists of 303 individuals data.
There are 15 columns in the dataset, however the first column name is not a good parameter as far as machine learning is considered so, there are effectively 14 columns.

- _Age_ : displays the age of the individual.

- _Sex_ : displays the gender of the individual using the following format : 1 = male, 0 = female.
- _Chest-pain type_ : displays the type of chest-pain experienced by the individual using the following format : 1 = typical angina, 2 = atypical angina, 3 = non - anginal pain, 4 = asymptotic
- _Resting Blood Pressure_ : displays the resting blood pressure value of an individual in mmHg (unit)
- _Serum Cholestrol_ : displays the serum cholestrol in mg/dl (unit)
- _Fasting Blood Sugar_ : compares the fasting blood sugar value of an individual with 120mg/dl. If fasting blood sugar > 120mg/dl then : 1 (true) else : 0 (false)
- _Resting ECG_ : 0 = normal 1 = having ST-T wave abnormality 2 = left ventricular hyperthrophy
- _Max heart rate achieved_ : displays the max heart rate achieved by an individual.
- _Exercise induced angina_ : 1 = yes, 0 = no
- _ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest_ : displays the value which is integer or float.
- _Peak exercise ST segment_ : 1 = upsloping, 2 = flat, 3 = downsloping
Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy : displays the value as integer or float.
- _Thal_ : displays the thalassemia : 3 = normal, 6 = fixed defect, 7 = reversable defect
- _Diagnosis of heart disease_ : Displays whether the individual is suffering from heart disease or not : 0 = absence, 1,2,3,4 = present.
